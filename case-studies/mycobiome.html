                <h3>Background + Context</h3>

                        <p>
                            As a data scientist, I've always been interested in finding new ways to use data to solve
                            important
                            problems. One such problem is cancer detection. Every year, countless people are diagnosed
                            with
                            cancer,
                            and getting an accurate and timely diagnosis can be critical in saving lives. So, when I
                            heard
                            about the
                            idea that mycobiome data could be used to detect cancer, I was intrigued.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mycobiome is the collection of fungal organisms that live within our bodies. The idea
                            was
                            that by
                            analyzing these organisms, we could potentially detect the presence of cancer. A previous
                            study
                            had
                            already analyzed whether mycobiome data could distinguish between multiple common cancer
                            types
                            and found
                            that it could. However, my colleagues and I wanted to take this research further.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We had three main ideas. First, we wanted to investigate whether certain microbes were
                            associated with
                            late-stage cancer. If we could identify these microbes, we could potentially mute their
                            effects
                            to slow
                            down or prevent cancer progression. Second, we wanted to find out whether certain microbes
                            were
                            associated with early-stage cancer or recovery. If we could identify these microbes, we
                            could
                            potentially introduce them into the tumor mycobiome to affect its development. Lastly, we
                            wanted
                            to see
                            if mycobiome data could be used to accurately distinguish between cancer stages.

                <h3>Problem Produces an Idea</h3>
                <div class="casestudy-section">
                    <img src="images\stages.png" alt="consolidating stages" class="casestudy-img">
                    <p>
                        However, we quickly ran into a problem. We discovered that fungal data alone wasn't very useful
                        for
                        distinguishing between cancer stages. There were too many cancer substages, and accuracy was too
                        low.
                        So, we formulated a hypothesis.
                        <span class="bold">
                            If we consolidated cancer substages into the
                            main four and
                            reintroduced
                            certain features from the metadata, we might be able to achieve high accuracy in predicting
                            cancer
                            stage.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    To test our hypothesis, we started by using the same dataset from the original analysis. We
                    reintroduced
                    metadata features such as age, sex, and sample type, and consolidated the cancer stages by mapping
                    all
                    substages to the parent stage. We also did some exploratory analysis and found that the dataset was
                    slightly unbalanced, with certain cancer stages more represented than others. So, we subsetted our
                    data
                    by disease type and ran our models on each subset before generalizing our model accuracies into a
                    weighted average.
                </p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    For classification, we made a gradient boosting classifier with stratified 10-folds cross-validation
                    using scikit-learn. For the gradient boost classifier, we used exponential loss, a learning rate of
                    0.1,
                    n-estimators 150, and a max depth of 3. During the project, I primarily worked on preprocessing the
                    data, which included initial data cleaning and setting up later model analysis.

                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our results were promising. <span class="bold">We were able to predict cancer stage with
                                high accuracy for
                                stages 1 and 4</span>

                            , but stages 2 and 3 were more muddled. We found that many of our metadata features were
                            one-hot
                            encoded,
                            so the most important features in the analysis became each unique value in the metadata.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            While our model accuracy was great, the relatively low scoring importance of the fungal
                            features
                            meant
                            that further analysis would be needed to determine what microbes could be responsible for
                            cancer
                            progression. Nonetheless, our findings showed that by introducing creativity and ingenuity
                            to a
                            well-studied dataset, novel results were still possible. We hope that other scientists will
                            see
                            the work
                            we've done and build upon it to expand cancer research.
