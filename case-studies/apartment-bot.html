                        <h3>The First of Many No's</h3>
                        <p>
                            I remember the summer of 2021 well. After months of planning, I was devastated to hear
                            that
                            I
                            couldn't
                            study abroad due to changes in my major prerequisites. It was a huge blow, and I felt
                            like I
                            had
                            hit a
                            dead end. I was faced with the daunting task of finding a place to live off-campus
                            during a
                            housing
                            crisis.
                        </p>
                        <h3>At the End of Every Line</h3>
                        <p>
                            I teamed up with three of my first-year roommates to find an apartment, but we quickly
                            found
                            out
                            that it
                            was going to be much harder than we thought. Every day, we called leasing offices and
                            followed
                            up on
                            Zillow and Apartments.com posts, but we were always too late. The properties we were
                            interested
                            in were
                            already gone, or we had to put our names on long waitlists in the hopes that
                            availability
                            would
                            open up.
                        </p>

                <h3>An Opportunity Presents Itself</h3>
                <p>
                    But one day, during a call with a leasing agent, I decided to ask for advice. I wanted to know
                    if
                    there
                    was anything we could do to improve our chances of finding a place to live. The leasing agent
                    told
                    me
                    something that would change everything: Zillow and other listing sites usually don't update
                    until a
                    day
                    or two after the apartment's personal website updates. <span class="bold">If we wanted to stay
                        ahead of the game,
                        we
                        would
                        have to check the availability directly through their site.</span>
                </p>
                <h3>Monty Python Makes The Holy Grail</h3>
                <p>
                    I knew this was a great tip, but I was lazy and didn't want to spend all day checking each
                    apartment
                    complex's website. So, I had an idea. I decided to write a Python script that would do the heavy
                    lifting
                    for me. The script would create a WebDriver to go onto the apartment's website, scrape the live
                    content,
                    hash the content, save that hash locally to my computer, and then send a text message to me and
                    my
                    future roommates if the hash was different from the previous run. I set the script to run every
                    thirty
                    minutes, 24 hours a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">A few days later, the bot found us an apartment that was close to a bus stop
                        and well within our
                        price
                        range.</span>
                    We applied and were approved quickly. We couldn't believe our luck! We were thrilled to
                    have
                    found a place to live during such a difficult time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back, I realized that being rejected from studying abroad had led me down a path I never
                    would
                    have imagined. It had forced me to be creative and come up with a solution that not only solved
                    my
                    problem but also helped my friends.
