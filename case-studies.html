            <h1>Mycobiome Cancer Analysis</h2>
                <h3>Background + Context</h3>
                <div class="casestudy-section">
                    <div class="casestudy-text">
                        <p>
                            As a data scientist, I've always been interested in finding new ways to use data to solve
                            important
                            problems. One such problem is cancer detection. Every year, countless people are diagnosed
                            with
                            cancer,
                            and getting an accurate and timely diagnosis can be critical in saving lives. So, when I
                            heard
                            about the
                            idea that mycobiome data could be used to detect cancer, I was intrigued.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mycobiome is the collection of fungal organisms that live within our bodies. The idea
                            was
                            that by
                            analyzing these organisms, we could potentially detect the presence of cancer. A previous
                            study
                            had
                            already analyzed whether mycobiome data could distinguish between multiple common cancer
                            types
                            and found
                            that it could. However, my colleagues and I wanted to take this research further.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We had three main ideas. First, we wanted to investigate whether certain microbes were
                            associated with
                            late-stage cancer. If we could identify these microbes, we could potentially mute their
                            effects
                            to slow
                            down or prevent cancer progression. Second, we wanted to find out whether certain microbes
                            were
                            associated with early-stage cancer or recovery. If we could identify these microbes, we
                            could
                            potentially introduce them into the tumor mycobiome to affect its development. Lastly, we
                            wanted
                            to see
                            if mycobiome data could be used to accurately distinguish between cancer stages.

                <h3>Problem Produces an Idea</h3>
                <div class="casestudy-section">
                    <img src="images\stages.png" alt="consolidating stages" class="casestudy-img">
                    <p>
                        However, we quickly ran into a problem. We discovered that fungal data alone wasn't very useful
                        for
                        distinguishing between cancer stages. There were too many cancer substages, and accuracy was too
                        low.
                        So, we formulated a hypothesis.
                        <span class="bold">
                            If we consolidated cancer substages into the
                            main four and
                            reintroduced
                            certain features from the metadata, we might be able to achieve high accuracy in predicting
                            cancer
                            stage.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    To test our hypothesis, we started by using the same dataset from the original analysis. We
                    reintroduced
                    metadata features such as age, sex, and sample type, and consolidated the cancer stages by mapping
                    all
                    substages to the parent stage. We also did some exploratory analysis and found that the dataset was
                    slightly unbalanced, with certain cancer stages more represented than others. So, we subsetted our
                    data
                    by disease type and ran our models on each subset before generalizing our model accuracies into a
                    weighted average.
                </p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    For classification, we made a gradient boosting classifier with stratified 10-folds cross-validation
                    using scikit-learn. For the gradient boost classifier, we used exponential loss, a learning rate of
                    0.1,
                    n-estimators 150, and a max depth of 3. During the project, I primarily worked on preprocessing the
                    data, which included initial data cleaning and setting up later model analysis.

                    <div class="casestudy-text">
                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our results were promising. <span class="bold">We were able to predict cancer stage with
                                high accuracy for
                                stages 1 and 4</span>

                            , but stages 2 and 3 were more muddled. We found that many of our metadata features were
                            one-hot
                            encoded,
                            so the most important features in the analysis became each unique value in the metadata.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            While our model accuracy was great, the relatively low scoring importance of the fungal
                            features
                            meant
                            that further analysis would be needed to determine what microbes could be responsible for
                            cancer
                            progression. Nonetheless, our findings showed that by introducing creativity and ingenuity
                            to a
                            well-studied dataset, novel results were still possible. We hope that other scientists will
                            see
                            the work
                            we've done and build upon it to expand cancer research.

                            <p>
                                I remember the summer of 2021 well. After months of planning, I was devastated to hear
                                that
                                I
                                couldn't
                                study abroad due to changes in my major prerequisites. It was a huge blow, and I felt
                                like I
                                had
                                hit a
                                dead end. I was faced with the daunting task of finding a place to live off-campus
                                during a
                                housing
                                crisis.
                            </p>
                            <h3>At the End of Every Line</h3>
                            <p>
                                I teamed up with three of my first-year roommates to find an apartment, but we quickly
                                found
                                out
                                that it
                                was going to be much harder than we thought. Every day, we called leasing offices and
                                followed
                                up on
                                Zillow and Apartments.com posts, but we were always too late. The properties we were
                                interested
                                in were
                                already gone, or we had to put our names on long waitlists in the hopes that
                                availability
                                would
                                open up.

                    <h3>An Opportunity Presents Itself</h3>
                    <p>
                        But one day, during a call with a leasing agent, I decided to ask for advice. I wanted to know
                        if
                        there
                        was anything we could do to improve our chances of finding a place to live. The leasing agent
                        told
                        me
                        something that would change everything: Zillow and other listing sites usually don't update
                        until a
                        day
                        or two after the apartment's personal website updates. <span class="bold">If we wanted to stay
                            ahead of the game,
                            we
                            would
                            have to check the availability directly through their site.</span>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Monty Python Makes The Holy Grail</h3>
                    <p>
                        I knew this was a great tip, but I was lazy and didn't want to spend all day checking each
                        apartment
                        complex's website. So, I had an idea. I decided to write a Python script that would do the heavy
                        lifting
                        for me. The script would create a WebDriver to go onto the apartment's website, scrape the live
                        content,
                        hash the content, save that hash locally to my computer, and then send a text message to me and
                        my
                        future roommates if the hash was different from the previous run. I set the script to run every
                        thirty
                        minutes, 24 hours a day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">A few days later, the bot found us an apartment that was close to a bus stop
                            and well within our
                            price
                            range.</span>
                        We applied and were approved quickly. We couldn't believe our luck! We were thrilled to
                        have
                        found a place to live during such a difficult time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking back, I realized that being rejected from studying abroad had led me down a path I never
                        would
                        have imagined. It had forced me to be creative and come up with a solution that not only solved
                        my
                        problem but also helped my friends.
