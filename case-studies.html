            <h3>Mycobiome Cancer Analysis</h3>
            Introduction and Context:
            As a part of a research project, I worked in a group of six during the first quarter to replicate a
            previously conducted study. The study aimed to distinguish between the top thirteen most common cancers
            solely through mycobiome data. During the second quarter, I worked with a subsetted group of three to
            conduct a novel study on the same dataset. Our focus was to recombine metadata features into our full
            dataset in order to improve the accuracy of models previously tried in the original study.

            Problem:
            We attempted to create a classification model to distinguish between different cancer stages using combined
            metadata and genomic reads. However, our team faced significant challenges due to our lack of experience
            with genomic data. Although we had some success in creating the classification model, we suffered from
            ambitious goals with poor follow-through.

            How we solved it:
            Despite the challenges we faced, I believed that I could greatly improve our final models in little time by
            simplifying its input and tuning hyperparameters. As a result, I took the lead in simplifying the input and
            tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Additionally, I worked closely with my team to improve our
            communication and ensure we were on the same page.

            Solution:
            Our revised model focused on a simplified input with tuned hyperparameters. We combined mycobiome and
            metadata features to create a classification model that could classify cancers by their stage. By combining
            the two types of data, we were able to achieve better accuracy in our models.

            Results:
            The final deliverables for this project were a website, poster, report, and GitHub repository. Our poster
            showed the accuracy of classification across different cancer stages, a feature space showing separation
            between cancer types, and a bar plot showing the most important features to our analyses. With our revised
            model and improved communication, we were able to achieve our goals and create a successful classification
            model. Overall, our work has the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate cancer
            diagnoses in the future.
            <h3>Apartment Bot</h3>
            As June of 2021 rolled around, I was eagerly awaiting the chance to study abroad. I had spent almost six
            months planning and meeting with advisors to ensure everything was in order. Unfortunately, my hopes were
            dashed when I learned that the prerequisite changes for core classes in my major had made it impossible for
            me to go overseas. It was a huge disappointment, but I tried to make the best of it.

            At the last minute, during the height of a housing crisis, I was forced to join three of my first-year
            roommates to find an apartment off campus. We were all in the same boat, and we quickly realized that
            finding a place to live was going to be more difficult than we had anticipated. Every day, we called leasing
            offices and followed up on Zillow or Apartments.com posts. We soon learned that many properties were already
            taken, despite having just been posted.

            We started adding our names to waitlists in the hopes that availability would open up. But it seemed like we
            were just wasting our time. Then, one day, during a call with a leasing agent, I asked if he had any advice
            for students in our position. He told us something that changed everything.

            He explained that Zillow and other sites often don't update until a day or two after an apartment's personal
            website updates. That meant we needed to check availability directly through the property's site. I was
            intrigued by this idea, but I didn't want to spend all day checking websites. That's when I had an idea.

            I decided to write a Python script that could automate the process for me. For each of the apartment
            complexes I was interested in, the script would create a WebDriver, go onto the apartment's website, scrape
            the live content, hash the content, and save that hash locally to my computer. If the hash was different
            from the previous run, the script would send my future roommates and me a text message telling us which
            apartment complex had updated its availability.

            It wasn't an easy task, but I persevered. I set the script to run every thirty minutes, 24 hours a day. It
            wasn't long before the script started working its magic. Whenever an apartment complex updated its
            availability, I received a text message, and I could quickly check the website to see if it was something we
            were interested in. It was a game-changer for us.

            A few days later, we found and were approved for an apartment that was close to a bus stop and well within
            our price range. It was a huge relief, and we were all grateful for the Python script that had made it
            possible. In the end, it just goes to show that sometimes the best solutions come from thinking outside the
            box.
